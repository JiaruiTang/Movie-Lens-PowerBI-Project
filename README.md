## Overview
This project analyzes classic movies (released until the year 2000) for MovieLens, a company specializing in providing comprehensive online databases of films, TV series, and streaming content. The analysis in this project belongs to the "Movie Talkies: Classic" edition, which aims to engage classic movie enthusiasts and attract new viewers by offering insights into the characteristics of these movies, user interests, and how demographics relate to movie ratings.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create a detailed report using PowerBI, providing insights into classic movies and their audience. The report created is expected to connect with viewers who have strong movie preferences as well as promote classic movies to attract newer customers and expand their viewer base.

1. How many movies were released until 2000, and how many distinct genres are there until 2020?
2. What is the size and gender diversity of the MovieLens community?
3. What are the genre preferences across different genders?
4. What's the average user rating for classic movies and how do genres distribute among them?
5. What does the demographic distribution look like across gender, and where do these users reside?
6. How do different age groups and professions engage with classic movies?
7. Which classic movies and genres are top-rated, and how do ratings vary by age and occupation?
